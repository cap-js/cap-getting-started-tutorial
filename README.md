# Getting started with CAP 

## Description

In this hands-on tutorial you will learn to create your first CAP application. It will be a very basic, yet fully functional application including a Fiori Elements UI.

## Prerequisite

- A internet browser. Preferrably Google Chrome. 

## Exercises

**Hint:** CAP has 2 runtime stacks: CAP Java and CAP node.js

For this tutorial we describe the steps for both stacks. You're invited to test both. In a real world project you need to decide for one stack based on your team's skillset and the (non-functional) requirements of your project.
